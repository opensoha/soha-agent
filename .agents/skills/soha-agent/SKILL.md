# Soha Agent

## Overview

Use this skill for the `soha-agent` repository only. The agent is a standalone
runtime that exposes local cluster and runtime APIs, claims work from the Soha
control plane, and calls back with task, Docker, or Agent Runtime results.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/go-engineering-standards.md` for every production Go change. Keep `cmd/agent/main.go` thin. Startup belongs in `internal/agent/bootstrap`, config in `internal/agent/config`, HTTP surfaces in `internal/agent/api`, Kubernetes access in `internal/agent/kubernetes`, and control-plane execution in `internal/agent/runner`.
2. Do not import core `github.com/opensoha/soha/internal/**` packages. Share API shapes through released `github.com/opensoha/soha-contracts` types.
3. Use `SOHA_AGENT_CONFIG_FILE`, `SOHA_AGENT_*` env overrides, and `configs/agent.config.yaml` as the config path. Keep viper env keys aligned with config struct tags.
4. When adding a runtime capability, decide whether it belongs to the local HTTP API, Kubernetes adapter, execution or Docker runner, Identity Outpost, environment runtime manager, Agent Runtime provider, or packaging. Put it in the existing owner.
5. Keep diagnostics safe. `/api/v1/diagnostics` may summarize readiness and counts; it must not expose bearer tokens, kubeconfig contents, command secrets, or raw internal failures.
6. For broad package or dependency changes, query `graphify-out/graph.json`. Refresh it only after source changes are stable and the worktree contents are understood; use `--force` after deletions and run diagnostics.

## Architecture Rules

- Keep `internal/agent/api/server.go` focused on Gin construction, middleware, route registrar calls, and server lifecycle. Add endpoint families to focused `routes_*.go` files; do not rebuild a monolithic server or God Service across multiple files.
- Keep interfaces narrow and owned by the consuming package. Wire concrete Kubernetes and runner implementations in bootstrap; do not add globals, `init` service setup, a DI container, or imports from the core Soha internals.
- Keep provider-specific Kubernetes/Helm and runner execution details behind their owning packages. HTTP handlers parse, authorize, delegate, and map redacted responses only.
- Keep environment lease, launch, stop, snapshot, and cleanup behavior in `internal/agent/environment`; runners coordinate it through narrow interfaces.
- Preserve bounded concurrency, context cancellation, timeouts, stream limits, and graceful shutdown for every goroutine or external operation.

## Security Rules

- Production config must reject demo or short bearer tokens, wildcard mutation allowlists, unknown mutation actions, wildcard Docker operation kinds, and Docker terminal access without explicit `http.allowed_origins`.
- All mutating agent API routes must pass through `actionPolicy.Require(...)` with a named action constant.
- When adding a new mutation action, update `internal/agent/api/security.go`, `internal/agent/config/config.go` production validation, `configs/agent.config.yaml`, and focused deny/allow tests.
- Public error responses must stay generic. Keep details such as IPs, kubeconfig paths, tokens, Docker command output, and provider stderr out of HTTP error bodies.
- Action audit logs may record action, decision, route, request ID, client IP, and reason; never include secrets or raw request payloads.

## Runner Rules

- Execution, Docker, and Agent Runtime work are claim/heartbeat/callback loops. Preserve idempotency around terminal states, cancel, timeout, retry, and stale callbacks.
- Respect `control_plane.max_concurrency`, `default_timeout`, `callback_retry`, and workspace roots.
- Keep workspace path handling bounded under configured roots. Do not let task payloads write arbitrary host paths.
- For Agent Runtime providers, normalize provider output into control-plane callback contracts. Do not leak provider-native state directly into external APIs.
- Metrics and active-task views should reflect claims, misses, heartbeats, callbacks, failures, cancellations, and timeouts.
- Identity Outpost claim, heartbeat, access checks, signed configuration, and event delivery must preserve trust-key validation, configuration-lease replay protection, and redaction.

## Packaging Rules

- `deploy/Dockerfile` builds the generic `soha-agent` image.
- `deploy/Dockerfile.hermes-agent-runner` builds the Hermes-derived runner image.
- `deploy/kubernetes/**` is a starter manifest; Helm charts live in `opensoha/soha-helm`.
- Docker builds may use sibling `../soha-contracts` only as build context. The committed module should stay compatible with released contract tags.

## Testing

- Run focused package tests while iterating and the full gate in `references/go-engineering-standards.md` before completing production changes.
- Run `GOWORK=off go test ./...` for normal changes; do not rely on a sibling `go.work` or unreviewed local contract code.
- Run `go test ./internal/agent/api` for auth, action allowlist, route, and stream changes.
- Run `go test ./internal/agent/runner` for claim/callback, Docker runner, Agent Runtime, cancellation, timeout, and metrics changes.
- Run `go test ./internal/agent/environment` for environment lease, process/container runtime, snapshot, cleanup, and recovery changes.
- Run `go test ./internal/agent/kubernetes` for Kubernetes proxy behavior, YAML, logs, terminal, Helm, port-forward, and CRD changes.
- Run `go vet ./...` and `go test -race ./...` for concurrency or runner changes.

## CI Gate

Use Go `1.26.5` and run the full gate for dependency, packaging, Dockerfile, workflow, or release changes:

```bash
GOWORK=off go mod tidy
git diff --exit-code -- go.mod go.sum
GOWORK=off go mod verify
GOWORK=off go test ./...
GOWORK=off go test -race ./...
GOWORK=off go vet ./...
GOWORK=off go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.3.0 ./...
GOWORK=off CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /tmp/soha-agent ./cmd/agent
kubectl kustomize deploy/kubernetes/outpost | kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f -
docker build --build-context contracts=../soha-contracts -f deploy/Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/opensoha/soha-agent:test .
docker build --build-context contracts=../soha-contracts -f deploy/Dockerfile.hermes-agent-runner -t ghcr.io/opensoha/soha-hermes-agent:test .
git diff --check
```

CI also runs `golangci-lint v2.9.0` with only-new-issues semantics. A missing local Docker or Kubernetes CLI prerequisite must be covered by the corresponding successful GitHub Actions job.
